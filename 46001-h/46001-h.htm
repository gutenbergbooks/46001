That is extremely true and very pretty. Moreover, it is a very noble
employment, this acting in behalf of the foremost railway of the world. Still,
we are not altogether happy. Since our queen banished Iolanthe, our life has not
been a transcendent one.</p>

<p class="drop-cap space-above1"><b>LEILA</b>&mdash;
Ah, Iolanthe was a whole team, and, like the Alton Road, she was
the only one in the crowd who carried a proper train. But according to the
laws of Fairydom, she committed an unpardonable sin. The fairy who marries a
mortal must die.</p>

<p class="drop-cap space-above1"><b>QUEEN</b>&mdash;
No, because your queen, who loved her as much as a member of the
State legislature loves a railway pass, commuted her sentence to travel for
life on other lines, and sooner than do it she confined herself in a pond.</p>

  <img class="drop-cap" src="images/letter_l.jpg" alt="L" width="19" height="26" />

invisible down to the waist, I have collected damages from one railway company
several times, because they couldn't find the rest of me after an accident. My
legs, I suppose, will die some day, and then what will be the use of my bust? I
can't satisfy Phyllis with half a husband.

<p class="f150"><b>CHICAGO AND NEW YORK</b></p>

<p class="indent">The two cities above named are the great commercial centres of the
United States, the former containing in the vicinity of 650,000 inhabitants, and
the latter about 1,500,000. The number of people actually in Chicago at any one
time would doubtless range far above these figures, as its floating or transient
population is enormous, running up into figures that can hardly be credited.
The traffic passing between these two cities daily is very large, when one considers
that they are within a fraction of 1,000 miles apart. Boston also has a
large traffic with Chicago, and, to give an idea of the accommodations necessary
to provide for the passenger business alone between the three cities, we may state that the</p>

<div class="figcenter" >
  <img src="images/i_059.jpg" alt="MICHIGAN CENTRAL RAILROAD" width="588" height="67" />
</div>

<p>which is the principal thoroughfare between the cities named, runs five express
trains daily&mdash;three on Sundays&mdash;made up of fine new day coaches, smoking
cars, drawing-room cars, palatial sleeping cars.</p>

<p class="indent">The Michigan Central Railroad has always held a foremost place among
the lines between Chicago and the Atlantic seaboard, and the latest addition
to their accommodations, in the shape of four new Dining Cars, will greatly
strengthen its position.</p>

<p class="indent">These new cars are incomparable for beauty of design and selectness of
adornments, all the elegancies of art having been exhausted to produce the
most desirable effect. That the end has been gained goes without saying, and
they stand to-day as far in advance of other Dining Cars as the first Dining
Cars were in advance of the lunch counters at wayside stations.</p>

<p class="indent">The <i>cuisine</i> is quite on a par with the finish of the cars, and all that may
minister to the nourishment of the body or tickle the palate of the most discriminating
epicures will be found therein.</p>

<p class="indent space-below1">Other great features of the Michigan Central Railroad are that its through
trains for New York and Boston run out of Chicago along the Michigan Lake
front, within a stone's throw of the city's costliest mansions, through South
Park and the magic city of Pullman, affording an extensive survey of this
marvel of a marvelous age, and later passing over the new Cantilever Bridge
in full view of Niagara Falls. It is for this latter reason known to all travelers
as "The Niagara Falls Route."</p>

  <img src="images/i_061.jpg" alt="A TRIP TO NIAGARA FALLS." width="600" height="263" />
</div>

<p class="indent">"Come, Adele; come. Nellie; hurry up. Deacon Fitney
will be here directly and the train starts directly."</p>

<p class="indent">The voice was that of Mr. Trevellyan, a thoroughly well-known and highly
respected stock broker of the City of Chicago. Mr. Trevellyan was a hardworking
man, and his various affairs did not give him much opportunity of
absenting himself from his business. But to-day had been laid out as a holiday
for the babies, and Papa Trevellyan had made up his mind to take part in it.</p>

<p class="indent">After a good deal of family discussion [these things generally involve more
or less of that sort of thing] it was finally decided to make a trip to Niagara
Falls and back. So a party was made up which was to consist of Mr. and Mrs.
Trevellyan, the two children and a good-hearted Deacon Fitney, who was well
acquainted with the way to "do" the Falls properly.</p>

<p class="indent">The day was, as I have just said, a bright one, even for the month of June,
and both Adele and Nellie, in anticipation of a pleasant time, were not long in
putting on their things and repairing to the parlor.</p>

<p class="indent">It was well they hurried. There was papa, valise in hand, ready to start;
mamma, too; and nothing seemed to be wanting but the presence of Deacon
Fitney, who had gone off to secure the railway tickets, and who promised to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_61" id="Page_61">[Pg 61]</a></span>
return at once with a carriage and accompany the whole party to the train. The
Deacon was not long in coming back. He was a good man in his way, was the
Deacon. He had only one fault&mdash;he was unreasonably fond of Buttons! He
adorned his apparel with more buttons than even the law requires, and he wore a
nice gold-headed button on his neatly-tied satin scarf. Nobody could ever find
out what prompted this peculiarity, but then nobody seemed to care very much.
However, as I said before, the Deacon came back very quickly and helped get
things in the carriage.</p>

<p class="indent">"By the way, Deacon," said Mr. Trevellyan, "what time do we start and
which way do we go? You know I have left everything of that kind to you."</p>

<p class="indent">"Four-fifteen," said the Deacon, in a cheerful sort of way, "and by the
Michigan Central Railroad. It is the only way to go. But never mind about the
advantages to be gained by going over this remarkable route. I will tell you all
about it when we get on the train."</p>

<p class="indent">And so they bundled into the carriage, and within a few minutes the entire
party was seated in one of the magnificent palace cars which are attached to the
Michigan Central Limited Express.</p>

<p class="indent">"All aboard!" shouted the conductor. "We're off," smiled the Deacon.
The big clock in the depot struck the quarter after four, and the magnificent train,
composed of five sleepers, three coaches, a palace dining car and a couple of
baggage cars, slowly pulled out of the station.</p>

<p class="indent">Adele and Nellie glued their noses to the window, and their delight as they
whizzed through the beautiful suburbs of South Chicago seemed unbounded.
With Lake Michigan, tranquil and glittering with the rays of a summer sun, on
one side, and a succession of lovely suburban residences on the other, the sight
was a most lovely one. A few minutes later the train was flying through green
fields and beautiful woods.</p>

<p class="indent">"Here, children," suddenly cried the Deacon from the other side of the car,
"come quick and see the magic city of Pullman." In a minute Adele was on
one of the Deacon's knees and Nellie on the other, and the train passed rapidly
by the most wonderful evidence of modern enterprise.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_62" id="Page_62">[Pg 62]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"Three years ago," said the Deacon, in answer to an enquiring look of
admiration in the children's eyes, "the ground on which stands this most beautiful
city, which is without doubt the model city of the world, was nothing but a
swamp. See what it is now. Some day, when we get back home, I will bring
you here and let you learn more closely what the creator of the beautiful place
which bears the name of Pullman has done for his country."</p>

<p class="indent">A minute later the train flew past Kensington, and then fairly started on its
iron way for its first stopping place, Michigan City, better known as the City of
Sand. Then came Niles, with it wonderful bridge and its fairy valley. Then
Kalamazoo, the biggest village in the world and the flower bed of creation. Then
Marshall, Battle Creek and, Jackson, the latter place the centre of railway industry
of the beautiful State of Michigan. Then Ann Arbor, where is situated the
University of the State of Michigan, and then, last but not least, Detroit.</p>

<p class="indent">By this time, of course, the babies had been tucked in bed. The Deacon had
taken them into the dining car and feasted them with all the inexhaustible
luxuries for which these cars on the Michigan Central R. R. are so famous.</p>

<p class="indent">Then, the colored porter having made up their beds, they were soon fast
asleep and dreaming of the treat in store for the morrow.</p>

<p class="indent">The Deacon, however, was determined at least that his grown-up friends
should lose none of the beauties of the trip, and so he insisted that Mr. and Mrs.
Trevellyan should remain up until they had crossed the famous Detroit River.
The night was a beautiful one, and they were amply rewarded by witnessing one
of the most thoroughly picturesque pieces of scenery in the world. The entire
train was placed on one of the immense ferry steamers, and the landing shortly
afterwards made at Windsor, a picturesque and quaint little town on the Canadian
side of the river. At this point commences the Canada Southern Division of the
Michigan Central Railroad, famous alike for the magnificence of its equipment
and smoothness of track. Here our friends, so to speak, turned in, and it was
only a few minutes before every one on board was fast asleep.</p>

<p class="indent">The next thing was the morning sun and Niagara Falls. The run had been
made from Chicago in the remarkable time of fifteen hours.
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_63" id="Page_63">[Pg 63]</a></span></p>

<p class="indent">"Oh, how good of you, Deacon Fitney," said little Adele a short while later,
as, standing on the platform at Falls View Station, she gazed with rapture at the
Falls in all their splendor. "How good of you to bring us to such a nice place,
and by such a delightful road."</p>

<p class="indent">And little Adele had reason to so express herself, for, standing where she was,
at Falls View Station, she was able to command the most awe-inspiring and lovely
view of the Falls to be obtained anywhere.</p>

<p class="indent">"I am glad you like it," said the Deacon, with a smile; "but you must not
credit me with too much goodness, for I could hardly have brought you by any
other way. The Michigan Central road is the only direct road running to the
Falls, and you could hardly expect that I could take you there by any line
which is not entirely the best."</p>

<p class="indent">Mr. and Mrs. Trevellyan heartily joined Adele in her expressions of thanks
to the Deacon, and more than endorsed every word he had said in praise of the
wonderful Michigan Central Limited Express.</p>

<p class="indent">The conductor then called "all aboard," and the train again started on its
way, and very shortly crossed the Niagara River over the magnificent steel Cantilever
bridge which the Michigan Central people have just erected at this point.</p>

<p class="indent">"This is the great Cantilever bridge you have heard so much about," said the
Deacon to little May. "It is the greatest scientific engineering effort of the age,
and it is well worth visiting Niagara, if only to see it. With Niagara Falls and
the Cantilever bridge the Michigan Central people are able to show their passengers
the greatest work of nature and of man to be found in the country."</p>

<p class="indent">From the bridge the train glided along to Niagara Falls station, on the
American side. Here our little party alighted, and, after driving about the village,
they soon found themselves in the comfortable parlors of the Clifton House, enjoying
one of Mr. George Colburn's justly famous repasts.</p>

<p class="indent">Then they spent the day at the Falls&mdash;a day of merry sunshine and happiness.
The Falls never looked grander, and nature never smiled with more sweetness.
The time passed only too quickly, and when the children stepped on the cars once
more to return to Chicago, it was with a twinge of regret which was only offset by
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_64" id="Page_64">[Pg 64]</a></span>
the knowledge that they had another delightful trip in store for them on the
Michigan Central road.</p>

<p class="indent">Now Adele has the following time table hung up among her pictures on the
wall in her bed room. She says it serves to remind her of one of the happiest
days of her life. Above it, in a baby's handwriting, she has scrawled:</p>

it may be asserted without fear of truthful contradiction, that the</p>

<p class="f150"><b>CHICAGO &amp; NORTH-WESTERN RAILWAY</b></p>

<p class="indent">Is not only the best and most perfectly equipped railroad in the world, but it is also the most important
as to the territory it traverses, the numerous business centres and pleasure resorts that it reaches, and the facilities
it offers for pleasant, speedy, safe and comfortable transit for all classes of passengers. It caters alike to
the needs, tastes and abilities of the millionaire merchant prince; to the farmer, with his plain and simple
wants; and to the economical and necessitous; and gives to each the full value of all he pays for. Its luxuriantly
finished and furnished palace sleeping cars and its more than luxurious drawing-room coaches are
marvels of beauty and comfort. Its coaches are new and of the most perfect models that have been adopted
by any company, and they are always kept sweet, clean and pure. Its dining cars are superb, and the meals
and service provided in them are equal to that given by any first-class hotel in the country.</p>

It is eminently <i>the</i> railroad of the Northwest, and
from its commanding location it controls the traffic of all of the territory it traverses.</td>
    <td align="left">Over 5,000 miles of the best built and best maintained railroad there is in the country.

<p class="indent">This Company's line between Chicago and Council Bluffs (Omaha) <i>is shorter</i> than any other
between these points, and was the pioneer in forming connection with the Trans-Continental Union and Central
Pacific Railroads. Nearly all experienced overland travelers seek this line, because it is known to be the best,
shortest, most comfortable, and in every way the most desirable. To seek other more circuitous and inferior
routes is accepted as an evidence of inexperience or want of information.</p>

<p class="indent">If you are destined to or from Colorado, Nebraska, Utah, Wyoming, Montana, Idaho, Nevada, California,
Oregon, Washington Territory, China, Japan, the Sandwich Islands, New Zealand or Australia, you should,
in making the trip between Chicago and Council Bluffs (Omaha), in either direction, see that your tickets
read over this great road.</p>

<p class="f150"><b>ST. PAUL, MINNEAPOLIS &amp; WINNIPEG.</b></p>

<p class="indent">This road, "St. Paul Line," is the short and desirable route between Chicago and Madison, St. Paul
and Minneapolis; Helena, Montana; Portland, Oregon, and points on the Northwest Pacific coast, and the best
to travel over if you are destined to or from Chicago and any point north or northwest of St. Paul. Winona
and Mankato, Minn.; Frankfort, Huron, Pierre, Aberdeen, Columbia and Watertown, Dakota; Milwaukee,
Fond du Lac, Oshkosh, Watertown and Sheboygan, Wis.; Freeport, Elgin, Dixon and Fulton, Ill.; Clinton,
Cedar Rapids, Des Moines, Webster City, Algona, Tama and Council Bluffs, Iowa, are a few of its hundreds
of prominent local stations. It reaches most of the pleasant summer resorts of Wisconsin and Minnesota,
and is the road to take for the health and scenic resorts of the Rocky Mountains, the National Yellowstone
Park, and nearly all of the notable Western and Northwest resorts that are accessible by rail.</p>

<p class="indent">It connects in Union Depots with the Union Pacific Railway at Council Bluffs, and at St. Paul with
the Northern Pacific St. Paul, Minneapolis &amp; Manitoba, and with all roads diverging from that point.</p>

<p class="indent">You can procure tickets over this route from nearly every coupon ticket agent in the country. When
buying your tickets read them carefully and be sure that at least one coupon reads over the <span class="smcap">Chicago &amp;

<p class="indent"><i>The Chicago and Atlantic Railway runs solid Pullman trains, the
  finest ever built, daily between Chicago and New York, etc., by way
  of the Erie Railway, and through its valuable connections reaches
  every important point in the entire country. The construction and
  equipment of the road are of the most perfect description, all
  that modern skill can compass having been called into requisition
  to ensure safety, comfort, speed and reliable connections, without
  having to change cars. This popular line, being almost literally
  straight, forms the shortest, quickest and most direct route to Lake
  Chautauqua, the highest navigated water on the globe. In equipment
  the Chicago and Atlantic Railway is excelled by none and equaled
  by few roads in the world. Their superb sleeping, drawing-room and
  thoroughfare coaches are simply models of elegance and comfort and
  are lighted with the brilliant Pintsch gaslight. Clean bedding, thick
  hair mattresses, thorough ventilation and absolute safety, with
  polite conductors and porters accompanying each car to provide for
  the wants of passengers, are valuable facts not to be overlooked.
  Each train has its smoking cars, which among other novelties contain
  a buffet, where the traveler may lunch at his leisure. Indeed, the
  company have provided every luxury, convenience and solid comfort for
  the traveling public, hence their road is liberally patronized.</i></p>
